                    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

                    1. Definitions.

                    "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
                    and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

                    "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
                    the copyright owner that is granting the License.

                    "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
                    other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
                    control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
                    "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
                    direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
                    otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
                    outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

                    "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
                    exercising permissions granted by this License.

                    "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
                    including but not limited to software source code, documentation
                    source, and configuration files.

                    "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
                    transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
                    not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
                    and conversions to other media types.

                    "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
                    Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
                    copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
                    (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

                    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
                    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
                    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
                    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
                    of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
                    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
                    the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

                    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
                    the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
                    to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
                    submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
                    or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
                    the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
                    means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
                    to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
                    communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
                    and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
                    Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
                    excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
                    designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

                    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
                    on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
                    subsequently incorporated within the Work.

                    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

                    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                    as of the date such litigation is filed.

                    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                    meet the following conditions:

                    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

                    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                        stating that You changed the files; and

                    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                        the Derivative Works; and

                    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                        as modifying the License.

                    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                    the conditions stated in this License.

                    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

                    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

                    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

                    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                    "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
                    other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
                    control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
                    "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
                    direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
                    otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

                    "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
                    transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
                    not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

                    "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
                    Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
                    copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
                    (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

                    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
                    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

                    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
                    of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
                    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,

                    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
                    the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
                    to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
                    submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
                    or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
                    the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
                    means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

                    communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
                    and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
                    Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
                    excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
                    designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

                    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
                    on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
                    subsequently incorporated within the Work.

                    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

                    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                    as of the date such litigation is filed.

                    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                    meet the following conditions:

                    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

                    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                        stating that You changed the files; and

                    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                        the Derivative Works; and

                    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                        as modifying the License.

                    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                    the conditions stated in this License.

                    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

                    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

                    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

                    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                        "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.

                        "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.

                        "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

                        "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

                        "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

                        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.

                        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

                        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

                        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

                        You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

                        You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and

                        You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

                        If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

                        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

                        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

                        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

                        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

                        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
